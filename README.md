# Operators in C++ and Conditional Statements

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **operators** and **conditional statements** in C++.  
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values, while conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.  
Understanding these concepts is essential for writing logical, efficient, and interactive programs.

## Theory

### 1. Operators in C++
In C++, operators are used to perform various operations on variables and values. They are grouped into several categories:

####  Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations:
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (remainder)

####  Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values:
- `==` Equal to  
- `!=` Not equal to  
- `>` Greater than  
- `<` Less than  
- `>=` Greater than or equal to  
- `<=` Less than or equal to  

####  Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions:
- `&&` Logical AND  
- `||` Logical OR  
- `!` Logical NOT  

####  Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:
- `=` Assign  
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` Compound assignments

### 2. Conditional Statements in C++
Conditional statements control the flow of a program by evaluating whether expressions are `true` or `false`.

####  `if` Statement
Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

####  `if-else` Statement
Chooses between two blocks of code.

####  `else` Statement
Executes a block of code if a condition is not true.

### **2. Number Sign Checker**
This program:
- Checks whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional logic

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Basic condition checking
- if-else structure
- Use of comparison operators

---

### **3. Quadrant Locator**
This program:
- Determines in which quadrant a point lies on the Cartesian plane based on its x and y coordinates
- Handles edge cases like origin or points on axes

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Compound conditions using `&&`
- Multiple `else if` branches
- Applying geometry concepts through logic

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

- **Operators** are the foundation of logic and computation in C++.  
- **Conditional statements** enable decision-making and program flow control.  

From this project, you learn how to:
1. Use different types of operators
2. Evaluate expressions
3. Apply logic in conditional statements
4. Create interactive and responsive C++ applications
