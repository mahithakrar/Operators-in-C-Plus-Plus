# Operators-in-C-Plus-Plus

Overview:
This project demonstrates the use of different **operators in C++**. Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. 
Understanding how they work is essential to writing logical and efficient C++ programs.

Theory:
In C++, operators are used to perform various operations on variables and values. They are grouped into several categories:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations:
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (remainder)

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values:
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions:
- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR
- `!` Logical NOT

4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:
- `=` Assign
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` Compound assignments


Conclusion:
Operators are the foundation of logic and computation in C++. This program helps understand how to:
1)Use different types of operators
2)Evaluate expressions
3)Apply logic in conditional statements
Mastering operators is essential for writing effective C++ programs, whether they are simple or complex.


#Conditional Statements

Overview:
The project demonstrates the use of **conditional statements** in C++. Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. These are essential in creating dynamic and interactive programs.

This example includes:
- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `else` statement

Theory:
Conditional statements control the flow of a program by evaluating whether expressions are `true` or `false`.

1. `if` Statement
Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

2. 'if-else' Statement
Chooses between two blocks of code.

3. 'else' Statement
Executes a block of code if a condition is not true.

Summary of the programs:

1.Grade Calculator
This program takes marks of five subjects from the user, calculates the average, and displays the corresponding grade using if-else conditions.
Key Concepts Used - Arithmetic operations
                    Average calculation
                    Multiple if-else blocks
                    Relational and logical operators

2.Finding whether a number is positive, negative or zero
This simple program checks whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional logic.
Key Concepts Used - Basic condition checking
                    if-else structure
                    Use of comparison operators


3.Quadrant Locator
This program determines in which quadrant a point lies on the Cartesian plane, based on its x and y coordinates. It also handles edge cases like origin or axes.
Key Concepts Used - Compound conditions using &&
                    Multiple else if branches
                    Understanding real-world geometry through logic

Conclusion:
Conditional statements are essential for decision-making in C++. 
This program helps beginners understand:
1)How different types of conditions are evaluated
2)How to control program flow using if, else, and switch
3)How to create interactive and responsive C++ applications
Understanding these structures is key to writing logic-driven programs.
